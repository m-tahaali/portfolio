                <h2>Implementations</h2>
                <p>I have done alot of work in Roblox. It all started from making games in Roblox Studio. But it soon
                    grew to much more. I started learning how to integrate roblox with other websites. My first main
                    project was integrating Discord with Roblox to make a cross platform chat. Then I moved on to work
                    with a group of developers to make a game, which did not turn out very well. After that I started to
                    work on the commercial side of Roblox. This is truly the point where I learnt the deep workings of
                    websockets, as well as backends. I have made automated fulfillment solutions for multiple roblox
                    games. These solutions allow for the buyer to list the item on shopify, and run a roblox bot and
                    express backend on a VPS. The backend handles the linking between Shopify and the bot through
                    websockets, while the bot physically interacts with Roblox and gives the buyer his/her items. Most
                    of the codes have been lost to time, or I do not have permission to publically share. I have however
                    uploaded a video of one of the automated fulfillment solutions in the demo.</p>
