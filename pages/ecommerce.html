                <h2>Implementations</h2>
                <p>I have worked on many E-Commerce platforms mainly in API Integrations. I have worked on Shopify,
                    K-Mart Australia, Catch Australia, Ebay and CostCo Australia. This has allowed me to work with both
                    REST and GraphQL APIs. Some of the solutions I have worked on are: automated dropshipping price and
                    stock setting, price and stock alerts, shopify auto product upload, amazon webscraping, and shopify
                    order autofulfillment. Below is the demo of two of the APIs I used, I can not give full code as the
                    code made is not open source.</p>
